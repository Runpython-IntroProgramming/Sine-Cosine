Assignment:

In this assignment you must use *list comprehensions* to generate sprites that show the behavior
of certain mathematical functions: sine and cosine. 

The sine and cosine functions are provided in the Python math library. These functions are used
to relate *angles* to *rectangular* (x,y) coordinate systems and can be very useful in computer
game design.

Unlike the last assignment using ggame`, this one will not provide any "skeleton" code to fill
in. You should use your submission for the Picture assignment 
(https://github.com/HHS-IntroProgramming/Picture) as a reference for starting this assignment. 

See:

for a detailed list of requirements for this assignment.
